    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###i. Efficiency: ShuffleNet was developed for efficiency. It implements group convolutions and channel shuffle operations that reduce computation while keeping accuracy relatively high.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###ii. Low Latency: This characteristic does well on real-time applications or situations where minimum processing time is required. Good for applications involving mobile or embedded devices, it helps where you would want to deploy the model in such scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###iii. Good for Image Classification: Even with its lightweight architecture, ShuffleNet performs very well concerning image classification tasks, including classification among many classes like Food-11\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason why it is best for Food-11**\n",
    "###1. The dataset has a manageable number of categories, i.e. 11 food types, thus making it faster and efficiency classifier on the catering models given limited resources.\n",
    "###2. Use in applications where deployment is intended on a mobile device without much accuracy sacrifice..\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. EfficientNet V2**\n",
    "\n",
    "###i. Squeeze and excitation blocks: This model uses squeeze and excitation block, which perfectly enhances the important feature representation by dynamically re-calibrating channel-wise feature responses. This helps in such cases when the object has been classified because it makes sure of the most relevant parts that make the images in the trained process focus on the most important attributes used for classification. This is specifically true within food classification applications due to textures and colors or fine details.\n",
    "\n",
    "###ii. High Accuracy: It uses Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automagically surf model scaling and thus ensure the best possible depth-width-resolution trade-off for a particular dataset. It adapts its structure dynamically based on dataset requirements, leading to higher accuracy with fewer parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "###iii. Fine tunes Well: This model is pre-trained extensively on data from large datasets such as ImageNet. As a result, it shows strong generalization ability toward food classification tasks. A structured feature extractor qualifies this model highly for transfer learning, in which less labeled data is needed for higher accuracy, making it extremely applicable for fine-tuning on specialized datasets like Food-11.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason why it is best for Food-11**\n",
    "###1.  Food recognition models generally result in real-time applications, like taking pictures of food for calorie tracking, stuff like menus in restaurants, and identifying food items. \n",
    "###2. This model is also very fast to classify images using light computing device.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. MobileNet V3**\n",
    "\n",
    "###i. Mobile Optimization: MobileNet V3 optimizes for mobile devices, which becomes a major advantage when model size and inference time become deciding factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "###ii. Efficient: MobileNet V3 applies depthwise separable convolutions to minimize parameters and computations. Therefore, compared to other networks, it is much lighter in weight without sacrificing much in accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "###iii. Good Tradeoff Between Accuracy and Speed: There is a tradeoff between an inference one can speed and one can accuracy, and MobileNet V3 is a good choice if both performance and efficiency are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason why it is best for Food-11**\n",
    "###1. The diversity shown in Food-11 images allows MobileNet V3 design to generalize greatly on such types of datasets without increasing heavy computations\n",
    "###2. A great choice when you need to balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, especially for applications on mobile devices or systems with limited computational power"
