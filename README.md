| **a1_part_1.ipynb**  | Jupyter Notebook (Python code)           | Implements core **CNN experiments** (e.g., VGG and initial dataset exploration) per the assignment instructions. Demonstrates model definitions, hyperparameter choices, training routines, and initial performance evaluation. |
| **a1_part_2.ipynb**  | Jupyter Notebook (Python code)           | Continues with **more advanced CNN tasks** (e.g., deeper VGG analysis or ResNet-based experiments). Covers additional training, visualization, deeper architecture explorations, gradient hook usage, and any follow-up analyses. |
| **a1_part_5.pdf**    | PDF document (theoretical tasks and derivations) | Contains the **theoretical portion** (Part V) of the assignment: mathematical questions related to CNN (e.g., calculating parameters, output dimensions) and LSTM derivations. Includes step-by-step proofs, formulas, and reasoning. |
